Terminal Growth
    Minimum Value: 0% to 1%
        When to Use:
        For companies in mature or declining industries.
        In cases where future growth is highly uncertain, or the company is likely to just keep pace with inflation.
        For companies in highly competitive or saturated markets.


    Moderate Value: 1% to 3%
        When to Use:
            For companies that are expected to grow in line with the broader economy.
            Suitable for companies in stable, mature industries with steady, predictable cash flows.
            This range aligns with the long-term growth rate of developed economies, like the US, where GDP growth typically averages around 2-3% per year.


    Maximum Value: 3% to 4%
        When to Use:
            For companies that are expected to grow slightly faster than the overall economy, perhaps due to competitive advantages or exposure to faster-growing sectors.
            For companies operating in emerging markets where economic growth rates are higher.
            Still, this rate should be used cautiously, as it implies a very optimistic long-term outlook.
